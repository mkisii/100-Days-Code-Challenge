                    <h3>Services we Offer</h3>
                    <p>To help in this task you will be guided by a translator who is an expert in the language that is the focus for that session, 
                        and a professional poet. They will offer insight into the nuances of the language and culture, and give helpful suggestions 
                        for the direction of the translation that is produced.</p>
                    <p>The Poetry Translation Centre is very proud to partner with the Aké Arts and Books Festival to present a special series 
                        of translation workshops on the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa</p>
                    <p>Taking place online via Google Meet, the workshops are the perfect way to keep yourself feeling creative, engaged and 
                        connected to the world at large</p>

                    <h3>Work Process</h3>
                    <p>Join like-minded poetry lovers from across the world to discover new poetry and different cultures, share insights and 
                        language skills, working together to open up a poem in its original language and reassemble it in English. The result 
                        will be new group translations of contemporary Nigerian poems by Oladapo Olatubosun, Auwalu Anwar and Amarachi Attamah.</p>
                    <p>Taking place online via Google Meet, the workshops are the perfect way to keep yourself feeling creative, engaged and connected 
                        to the world at large. A rough and ready guide translation is provided by the guest translator so there is no need to know the 
                            language being translated – simply sign up and bring your love of poetry and language.</p>
