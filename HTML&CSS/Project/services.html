                <p>To help in this task you will be guided by a translator who is an expert in the language that is the focus for that session, 
                    and a professional poet. They will offer insight into the nuances of the language and culture, and give helpful suggestions 
                    for the direction of the translation that is produced.</p>

                    of translation workshops on the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa</p>

                    connected to the world at large</p>
